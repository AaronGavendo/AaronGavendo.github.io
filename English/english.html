<h3>Hello, </h3>
<p>I have one year of experience in doing language exchange and tutoring my ESL friends in English. They recommended that I become a English tutor so here I am. I have experience in teaching Korean students that attend English Academies across Toronto. </p>

<p>I can help you in:</p>
<p>- Reading </p>
<p>- Writing </p>
<p>- Speaking </p>
<p>- Resume / Interview </p>

<p>Please just email me about what you need help with. If you're not sure I can prepare some practice for you. I can meet you anywhere along the Yonge line, preferably closer to North York Centre. Since I'm new I will just charge $10/hr and will give you some general conversation time afterwards if you want. </p>
